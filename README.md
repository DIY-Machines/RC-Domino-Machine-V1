# Arduino Remote Controlled Domino Laying Machine - With Blynk Bluetooth Control
3D Printed

How to 3D print and assemble your very own programmable and remote controllable automatic domino laying machine.

Who likes knocking down absurdly long runs of dominoes? I do. Who doesn't like laying them all by hand. I don't. That's why I made this. ðŸ˜Š 

I made a a detailed project video here: https://youtu.be/QsAplPLtriw 

Using some basic electronics this machine can line up well spaced rows of wooden dominoes. You can drive it around corners, forwards and backwards - just don't drive into your already laid dominoes. You can enter a list of instructions to your robot via the Arduino IDE, upload with USB and then send it on it's way to follow your instructions, or you can open the phone app and drive it live via bluetooth.
